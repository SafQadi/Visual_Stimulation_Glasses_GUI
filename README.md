<br />

## Description:
The "Visual_Stimulation_Glasses" GUI is a MATLAB graphical user's interface that represents the functioning of One- and the Multi-Segment Glasses used for the visual stimulation. The GUI simulates real glasses made of LCD material. It shows the different stimulation paradigms programmed for both glasses.

## Single Segment Glasses (OSG)
In the Single or (One)-Segment glasses (OSG) each glass consists of only one segment. Two stimulation patterns can be selected, which activate the stimulation glasses either in phase or out of phase. The stimulation signals can be modulated by a cosine signal and are displyed in the graphs.

## Multi Segment Glasses (MSG)
Each glass of the Multi-segment glasses consists of eight segments, four small inner segments and four large outer segments. Seven stimulation patterns are programmed in which the segments of the glasses are activated in different forms.

## Usage
The Stimulation as well as the modulation signal frequencies can be given in the input field labelled "Stimulation" and "Modulation", respectively. After pressing the "Start" button, the stimulation will be started. When changing the frequency of a signal or selecting another stimulation paradigm within one of the glasses, the stimulation can be restarted with the "refrech" button with no need for pressing the "Start" button again.
