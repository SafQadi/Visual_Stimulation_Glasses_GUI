# Visual_Stimulation_Glasses_GUI
The MATLAB graphical user's interface (GUI) "Visual_Stimulation_Glasses" represents the functioning of the One- and the Multi-Segment Glasses used for the visual stimulation.
It shows the different stimulation paradigms programmed for both glasses. 

## Single Segment Glasses (OSG)
 In the Single or (One)-Segment glasses (OSG) two stimulation patterns can be selected, which activate the stimulation glasses either in phase or out of phase. 
 The stimulation signal can be modulated by a cosine signal. The modulation signal frequency can be given in the input field labelled "Modulation". 

## Multi Segment Glasses (MSG)
 By the Multi-segment glasses, seven stimulation patterns are programmed in which the segments of the glasses are activated in different forms. 
 The stimulation frequency of both glasses can be given in the input field labelled "Stimulation". 
 
After pressing the "Start" button, the stimulation will be started. When changing the frequency of a signal or selecting another stimulation paradigm within one of the glasses, 
the stimulation can be restarted with the "refrech" button with no need for pressing the "Start" button again.
